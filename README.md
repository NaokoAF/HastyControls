### [Install on Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3456414574)

## Features
* Gyro Aiming (Motion Controls)
* Rumble support on many game actions (Configurable per action)
* Adjustable auto look (Camera automatically tilting to face where you're going)
* Adjustable deadzones, sensitivity, and power curve of the right stick
* All features highly configurable (Config/HastyControls.ini in the game's folder. Reloads automatically)
* And more things planned if I find the time

## Controller Support
* **Xbox:** Partial support. Controllers have no Gyro, but other features work perfectly.
* **DualShock 4 (PS4):** Fully supported. What I currently play with
* **DualSense (PS5):** Fully supported.
* **Switch Pro Controller:** Partial support. Menu navigation is broken, but playable.
* **Steam Deck:** Probably, but unknown at the moment, as I don't own one.

## My camera is turning on it's own!
This is known as Gyro Drift. To fix it, put your controller down on a flat surface and hold down the calibration button for about a second (click the touchpad by default).
To avoid this next time, leave the controller down while launching the game. It calibrates automatically on every launch.

## Why?
I'm a big fan of Gyro Aiming, but Haste doesn't support Mixed Input, as in, using the left stick to move while using the mouse to look around. Mixed Input is a requirement to use Steam Input's Gyro to Mouse feature.

That inspired me to make a mod that would simply allow for Mixed Input, but after not being able to make that work, the mod's scope instead quickly escalated to adding gyro controls to the game, later escalating to improved controls in general.

This was also a fun way to play around with what I learned from Jibb Smart's [GyroWiki](http://gyrowiki.jibbsmart.com/), and as a learning experience on modding Unity games.
