## Why?
I'm a big fan of Gyro Aiming, but Haste doesn't support Mixed Input, as in, using the left stick to move while using the mouse to look around. Mixed Input is a requirement to use Steam Input's Gyro to Mouse feature.

That inspired me to make a mod that would simply allow for Mixed Input, but after not being able to make that work, the mod's scope instead quickly escalated to adding gyro controls to the game, later escalating to improved controls in general.

This was also a fun way to play around with what I learned from Jibb Smart's [GyroWiki](http://gyrowiki.jibbsmart.com/), and as a learning experience on modding Unity games.
